## 🌟 Overview

Shell Utils is an educational framework designed to make shell programming accessible and powerful. It is the result of extensive work over many years, now available on GitHub. With over 280 documented scripts, it caters to both beginners and advanced users. Its main differentiator is the ability to interact with the major shells: **Bash, Zsh, and Fish**.

✅ Includes third-party scripts, such as those from [Fred's Imagemagick](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/index.php) *(credits maintained in the scripts)*.

### ✨ Key Features

- Dynamic recognition of scripts, functions, variables, and aliases
- Comprehensive documentation and help menus
- Shell compatibility (fish, zsh, bash)
- Rich collection of utility scripts
- Educational resources and tutorials

📌 The `help_shell` script lists functions like `sed_info` (to assist with using sed), providing quick tutorials on Linux commands. To create a simple function, just create a file `function.sh` and store it in `~/.shell_utils/scripts/helps/`. The `help_shell` script will be able to read them and display a complete list of educational functions and much more.
